# TCR-pipeline
This pipeline is designed to process TCR-seq data, with input data generating from MiXCR or CellRanger(format need to transform by hand).

It needs Java, Python, R, each with packages VDJTools, Numpy/Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn, DESeq2/ggplot2. Please install them in advance and assign them in this script by hand.

This script does not package up well, so just use it after you change that by your need.

More details please see the script.
